        Strict criteria:
        - Provide dependancy if needed
        - Provide ONLY the reward function code
        - Use Python format
        - Briefly comment on the function's logic
        - Give no additional explanations
        - Focus on the Gymnasium environment 
        - Take into the action space
        - STOP immediately after closing the ``` code block
